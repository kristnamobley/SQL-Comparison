# SQL-Comparison
Comparing Tables in SQL
## Overview

This SQL script compares two data submissions (Submission2 and Submission20) and identifies discrepancies between them. The goal was to compare specific fields such as `daysworked` and `hoursworked` between the two submissions and flag any mismatches.

### Problem Solved:
The task was to identify discrepancies where the data between the two submissions did not match. The script flags these mismatches by generating columns that contain a `1` for matches and `0` for mismatches.
